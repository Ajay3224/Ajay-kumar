It is : Image colorization is the process of adding color to grayscale images, a task that traditionally required manual intervention. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly through the use of transfer learning, have significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of this process. By leveraging pre-trained neural networks, such as those used in image classification, transfer learning allows for the reuse of learned features to predict colors in grayscale images with limited data. This paper explores the application of deep transfer learning for image colorization, highlighting the benefits of using pre-trained models to enhance performance and reduce training time. The approach results in more realistic and visually appealing colorized images, with promising results for both general and specialized use cases in computer vision.
